When computing recursive types, I have to stop after a certain number of recursive calls because either:

1. Either it will take so long and use so much memory to compute your type that it will affect editor or compilation performance.


2. I've detected that your type requires so many recursive calls that I think it may have been incorrectly defined to be infinitely deep.

E.g.

```ts
// Define a type which models Youtube comments, where any comment can have comment replies
type Comment<T> = { user: string, text: T, replies: Comment<T>[] }

// error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
type Test = Comment<string>
```

You should take a look at the type definition to check that its recursion terminates.


This is one of my most commonly-delivered errors! You've likely declared a function, for instance:

```ts
function myFunction({0}) {
  // Something in here...
}
```

But right now, I don't know what type `{0}` is supposed to be - so I've defaulted it to `{1}`.

The reason this is showing as an error is because you've got `"strict": true` in your TS Config.
